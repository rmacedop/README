## Hi :hand:

- I'm Renata Nader, nice to meet you.
- I am an English and Portuguese teacher, passionate about languages and linguistics. I am also a translator, mostly of cryptocurrencies, and this is probably where my passion about technology began to flourish.
- I started an IT course about 1 year ago, and since then I've been trying to learn as much as I can about programming languages.
- Interested in C, C#, Python, Sql, among others.
